   <h1>The Zombie Adventure Chooses You</h1>
   <h2>The Zombie Dilemma</h2>
   <p>Choose your way to survive in this new age apocalypse!</br></br>
   You have decided to put your medical skills to the test. The pressure is on while the your brother's life is in your hands. You rush to the cabinets and start to pull out random bottles of chemicals that you think may help cure your brother. You decide to mix three different colored chemcials that are red, blue, and green. The smell of the mixture ironically has a vanilla scent which excites your brother about the potential cure. Now it's time for the moment of truth. You stir the chemcials up really good to make sure they are well mixed and you make your brother drink it. Magically, the bite mark from the Ruby zombie disappeared. Your brother jumps up with joy and gives you the biggest hug he could give you. You escape back home to see that your parents are there safely. You tell them about the cure you created and they call the police to tell them. As soon as doctors found out about the cure they began working to create more amounts of your cure. With your creation the Ruby zombie outbreak was eliminated. You will forever go down in history as the savior of mankind.</p>
