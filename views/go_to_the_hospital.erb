The doctor examines your brother to make sure he didn't have any other bite marks. Do to the hundreds of people that ate the expired twinkies and needed the cure there was only one dose of it left for your brother. The doctor injected the cure in your brother. Your brother was feeling better and ran to give you the biggest hug a little brother could. He backed up and then asked why were you bleeding on your arm. The doctor seemed curious about the blood too. Suddenly, fear struck over your body as you turning into a man-eating Ruby zombie became a reality. The doctor grabbed a wet cloth to wipe off your arm.
